# Credit-risk-classification
--The dataset of historical lending activity was used to train and evaluate a model to identify borrower creditworthiness.
--A new repository called credit-risk-classification was created, cloned, and the provided starter code and data files were added to a folder named Credit_Risk.
--The lending_data.csv file was read into a Pandas DataFrame, the labels (y) were separated from the features (X), and the data was split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
--A logistic regression model was fitted using the training data, the testing data labels were predicted, and the model was evaluated by generating a confusion matrix and a classification report.
--A credit risk analysis report was written, including an overview, model performance metrics, and a summary with a recommendation on whether the model should be used by the company. Coding conventions were followed, and maintainable, reusable code was ensured.
